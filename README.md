Nomadic Pastoralists pose an interesting challenge to the administration of public health â€“ their populations are transient and oftentimes cross international borders as part of seasonal migration patterns. The stateless nature of nomadic groups often marginalizes them from the public administration of health more logistically situated for sedentary populations.<br/><br/>

Ultimately, malnutrition in the form of acute vitamin A deficiencies is highly associated with both seasonal and drought patterns that affect the milk supply of accompanying livestock that provide a critical component of micronutrients. We outline the growing threat to micronutrient security nomadic pastoralists face in the Northeastern Pastoral Zone in Kenya, centered around the Wajir District amid the growing extremes in global climate and general unaccountability for those that do not conform to sedentary lifestyles.<br/><br/>

The objective of Shepherd is to reduce seasonal acute micronutrient deficiencies as the result of decreased milk production during Jilaal. We aim to reduce the compounded cycle of deficiency and infection by targeting those most vulnerable during the appropriate months of Novemember to December. The initiative targets Nomadic pastoral children in USAID and UNESCO funded primary mobile school initiatives with a high dose Vitamin A supplements of 200,000 IU prior to the Jilaal season in November coordinated between fixed health care services based on existing structures and a Dugsi or mobile school teacher selected by the community and trained by EMACK and NOHA. This dosing shcedule will last for 4 months (December-April) to offer a 30% protective effect against mortality. <br/><br/>
